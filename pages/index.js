        The village of Dewlish has formed a Platinum Celebration committee to
        organise a series of fund raising events through 2021-2022 to raise
        money to hold a set of events to celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee
        over the extended bank holiday weekend of Thurs 2nd to Sun 5th June.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back in 2012 Dewlish celebrated the Queen's Diamond Jubilee marking 60
        years on the throne. The weekend was a great success and the money left
        over was donated to charity.
