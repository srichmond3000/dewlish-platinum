      <h2>Dewlish Village</h2>
      <p>
        The village of Dewlish is found cradled in a fold of the surrounding
        chalk hills straddled around a small stream, the Devil&apos;s Brook,
        from which it takes the name, which runs along the valley bottom and
        through the lower village.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dewlish accommodates around 110 houses with a population of about 300.
        The houses are of mixed style, age and construction with the predominant
        theme being of stone and flint. Thatched roofs used to be wide-spread
        and the village was twice the current size until a ravaging fire some
        centuries ago, aided by the thatched houses being close together,
        reduced the village to near the present dimensions. It was originally on
        the main road from Dorchester to Blandford Forum and whilst now well off
        the beaten track it remains the most centrally located community in
        Dorset, equidistant to both towns and county boundaries. It remains
        clear of the threat of further large expansion which has radically
        altered other small county villages, given the immense cost of providing
        services and adequate road links.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Parish Church of All Saint&apos;s which in part dates back to the
        12th Century is located in the centre of the village. A visit to the
        church will show the considerable influence of the Montmorency family
        who lived in the adjacent Manor House for many generations until the
        male line was lost in WW1. The last member, Lady Rachel, died in 1956.
        More so, not too many village churches can claim to be the last resting
        place of a military Field Marshall, Sir John Michel. GCB, who died in
        1886. At the village cross-roads close by will be seen the War Memorial,
        primarily to men of WW1, who last a sobering total of 20 from such a
        small community. They are, and surely always will be, remembered at a
        ceremony which closes the roads every Remembrance Sunday.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has a particularly remarkable Roman heritage with a large and opulent
        Roman Villa being excavated in fields near the grand mansion Dewlish
        House in 1974. A number of extensive mosaic panels from the site are now
        housed in the Dorset Museum, Dorchester, and are of a unique nature.
        Older than that was the remains of a fossilised tusk of an elephant
        showing how extreme the changes have been to this area.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the church the village benefits from a popular and well
        supported pub, The Oak, where dogs are allowed and are all known by name
        thus being a true part of a ‘country pub’! A busy and ancient Village
        Hall is another focal point, hosting a wide variety of cultural and
        community activities including a thriving Saturday morning Community
        Café, horse racing evenings, bingo, yoga, themed dining events, barn
        dances, Christmas and harvest dinners. The committee organise many of
        the village&apos;s happenings such as the very well supported and
        impressive annual Bonfire and Fireworks event and the yearly Fun Day
        Fete with Beacon Lighting and Jubilee Fair organised when relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whilst only a small village it is a hive of activity with a host of
        businesses based in and around the village. These range from T Shirt
        printing to Marquee supply and erection, from building to Landscape
        Gardening and Farming, with two family owned dairy farms, though arable
        use is still widespread. Some previously farm buildings have been
        converted into holiday lets and welcome a steady stream of visitors each
        year. On the southern outskirts is a large and prestigious vineyard
        producing high quality wines from the chalky soil which would have been
        familiar to the Romans who brought viticulture to the county.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dewlish has a variety of groups and activities with a very active
        ‘Ladies Group’ and a successful Cricket Club, though given the
        undulating nature of the local and surrounding landscape they have no
        flat enough pitch available and play in an adjacent parish! The cultural
        life of the village also boasts several classical musicians, a family
        group with a wide popular range and an author and poet.
      </p>
      <p>
        The village therefore is not only a busy but also a close knit community
        for old and new inhabitants alike. It is perhaps because of these
        working and business activities being based in the village and with a
        large proportion of the village both living and working nearby, that
        Dewlish is not a backwater but a vibrant part of South Dorset.
      </p>
      <p>
        All this, the setting, the people, the happenings and the timeless
        nature of the surrounds ensure that Dewlish retains its country
        atmosphere and unspoilt natural charm.
